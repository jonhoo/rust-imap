/// An enum representing message sequence numbers or UID sequence sets returned
/// in response to a `EXPUNGE` command.
///
/// The `EXPUNGE` command may return several `EXPUNGE` responses referencing
/// message sequence numbers, or it may return a `VANISHED` response referencing
/// multiple UID values in a sequence set if the client has enabled
/// [QRESYNC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7162#section-3.2.7).
///
/// `Deleted` implements some iterators to make it easy to use. If the caller
/// knows that they should be receiving an `EXPUNGE` or `VANISHED` response,
/// then they can use [`seqs()`](#method.seqs) to get an iterator over `EXPUNGE`
/// message sequence numbers, or [`uids()`](#method.uids) to get an iterator over
/// the `VANISHED` UIDs. As a convenience `Deleted` also implents `IntoIterator`
/// which just returns an iterator over whatever is contained within.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```no_run
/// # {} #[cfg(feature = "native-tls")]
/// # fn main() {
/// # let client = imap::ClientBuilder::new("imap.example.com", 993)
///     .native_tls().unwrap();
/// # let mut session = client.login("name", "pw").unwrap();
/// // Iterate over whatever is returned
/// if let Ok(deleted) = session.expunge() {
///     for id in &deleted {
///         // Do something with id
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Expect a VANISHED response with UIDs
